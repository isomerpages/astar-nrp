## Who are we?
The National Robotics Programme (NRP) is a national level programme that nurtures the robotics ecosystem in Singapore through funding research and development, to enhance the readiness of robotics technologies and solutions. Key considerations for NRP's R&D investments include potential for impactful applications in the [public sector](/research/#rds) and potential to create [differentiated capabilities](/research/#rect) for our industry. Tour around our website to find out more!

## Our aims
>"We envision a vibrant and innovative robotics ecosystem capable of providing solutions to fuel the Smart Nation initiative and to establish Singapore as a global centre of excellence for the study, research, development, making and applications of robotics solutions."  
  
\- *Professor Quek Tong Boon, Chief Executive, National Robotics Programme*  
  
## Significance of Logo
<img style="max-width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;" src="/images/nrp-logo.png">
  
The NRP logo shows the head of a robot on the left, with a human on the right, working together in harmony. Robots are here to enhance jobs and make it easier for the employees, freeing up their time for higher value tasks instead of focusing on lower value work. Just like how famous blockbusters and pop culture potrays the use of robots such as in The Jetsons, Iron Man, Star Wars, we envision a vibrant ecosystem where robotics are empowering people!
