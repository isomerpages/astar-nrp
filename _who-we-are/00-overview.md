The rounded square on the left represents a robot and the circle on the right represents a person. They are encapsulated by a larger rounded rectangle, signifying harmony of robots and people working together. The phrase "Robotics Empowering People" underscores the importance of pursuing robotics that provide value to our society and economy, and that enables people to have better lives and jobs. Just like Rosie in The Jetsons, or R2D2 and C3PO in Star Wars!
