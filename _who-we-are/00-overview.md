## Who we are
The National Robotics Programme (NRP) is the multi-agency national level programme that looks at end-to-end development of the robotics ecosystem in Singapore, from funding R&D to facilitating partnerships for translation and adoption, for creating economic and social impact. Tour around our website to find out more!

## Our Vision
>"We envision a vibrant and innovative robotics ecosystem capable of providing solutions to fuel the Smart Nation initiative and to establish Singapore as a global centre of excellence for the study, research, development, making and applications of robotics solutions."  
  
\- *Professor Quek Tong Boon, Chief Executive, National Robotics Programme*  
  
## Our Logo

The rounded square on the left represents a robot and the circle on the right represents a person. They are encapsulated by a larger rounded rectangle, signifying harmony of robots and people working together. The phrase "Robotics Empowering People" underscores the importance of pursuing robotics that provide value to our society and economy, and that enables people to have better lives and jobs. Just like Rosie in The Jetsons, or R2D2 and C3PO in Star Wars!

## Organisation Structure  
![NRP Organisation Structure](/images/orgstruct.png)

NRP comprises one existing unit and two new units being planned:
* Robotics R&D Office (R<sup>2</sup>DO) is responsible for identifying and funding differentiating robotics technologies and capabilities to build.
* (New in planning) Robotics Engineering Centre (REC) will be a federated network of engineering centres that works with public sector researchers and industry to support the translation of robotics technologies and capabilities into solutions that are ready for deployment.
* (New in planning) Robotics Ecosystem Development Office (REDO) will work with industry and partner agencies to foster greater public-private collaborations, grow our robotics industry and address ecosystem-level issues.
