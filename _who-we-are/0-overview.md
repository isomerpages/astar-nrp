> "The next 20 years will likely be even more exciting than the last. We are in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and the pace of change has quickened since COVID-19. Automation, robotics, AI and the IoT will not only change the way we live and work, but also how the SAF fights and operates."
  
\- *Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister*  

## Vision  
>"We envision a vibrant and innovative robotics ecosystem capable of providing solutions to fuel the Smart Nation initiative and to establish Singapore as a global centre of excellence for the study, research, development, making and applications of robotics solutions."  
  
\- *Professor Quek Tong Boon, Chief Executive, National Robotics Programme*  
  
## Mission  
Developing the local robotics ecosystem by nurturing local talents through pipelines such as our research projects, helping SMEs convert into technology providers to design and build robots in Singapore. We believe that robots should work in tandem with the people to uplift jobs and create additional value, as reflected in our tagline of "Robotics Empowering People".
  
## History  
The Robotics R&D Task Force convened in 2014 by the National Research Foundation (NRF), with Chairman Prof Quek Tong Boon, set out to identify key public sectors where there are benefits to develop robotics solutions for the mid term (3 to 5 years) and longer term (beyond 5 years) as well as to propose the long-term R&D strategy to build up robotics capbility in the local robotics ecosystem.  
  
Today, NRP has evolved since its inception with over 20 R&D projects, some of which has begun to bear fruits and make an impact in the lives of many for years to come.
