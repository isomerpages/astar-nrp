## Speech by DPM Heng  
> "Apart from healthcare, robotics and automation technology can be applied widely to transform sectors such as Construction, Manufacturing and Logistics. We announced the National Robotics Programme last year. We will now scale up our efforts, and in particular, work with solution providers to offer packaged solutions to SMEs at a reasonable cost. I will make available over $450 million to support the National Robotics Programme over the next three years."
