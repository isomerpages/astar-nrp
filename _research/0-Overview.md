## Overview  
The National Robotics Programme focuses on the research and development of key Robotics enabling technologies, while having projects with the public and private sector to utilise these enabling technologies for public-lead demand.
  
## Robotics Enabling Capability Technologies (RECT)  
There are currently 9 focus areas of the RECT Funding Initiative.

1. [Navigation & Perception](/research/nav-per/)  
2. [Human-Robot Interaction](/research/hri/)
3. [System Capabilities](/research/syscap/)
4. [Reconfigurable Robotics](/research/rec/)
5. ["Universal" End Effectors](/research/uni-end/)
6. [Assistive Robotics](/research/assistive/)
7. [Data-driven Robotics](/research/ddr/)
8. [Multi-robot Systems](/research/mrs/)
9. [Trusted Robotics](/research/trusted/)

## Robotics Domain Specific (RDS)
The focus remains on 3 domains for the service and deployment of robotics solutions, in mainly [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Environment](/research/environment/), and [Build Environment](/research/built-environment/). With the upgraded version of NRP2.0, Food will also be a sector that would be looked at.
