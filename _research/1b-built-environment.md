## Overview  
The Built Environment sector, spanning across construction and facility management, has heavy reliance on lower skilled foreign labour and manual tasks. Worldwide, there has also been increasing interest in this sector to look at robotics and automation technologies to reduce reliance on manpower, improving productivity and safety, and changing the way we build and maintain the buildings. In 2018, the Built Environment (BE) Robotics R&D Programme was initiated by BCA, tapping on NRP’s Robotics Domain-Specific (RDS) Funding Initiative, to develop robotics technologies and enablers for the BE sector and leverage on industry efforts in Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) and Smart Facilities Management (FM).
  
The programme is led by the Built Environment Research and Innovation Institute (BERII) from the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore.
