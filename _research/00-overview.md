## Overview  
Headed by R<sup>2</sup>DO, the R&D arm of NRP supports robotics research and development efforts through 2 funding initiatives; Robotics Enabling Capibility Technology (RECT) and Robotics Domain Specific (RDS).

RECT focuses on building up a strong scientific foundation with a critical mass of researchers to provide a continuous pipeline of robotics tenologies, whereas RDS works in three application sectors for the industry to take the lead to realise innovation and to deliver robotics solutions with the aim of deployment and commercialisation.
  
## Robotics Enabling Capability Technology (RECT) ## {#rect}
There are currently 9 focus areas of the RECT Funding Initiative.

1. [Navigation & Perception](/research/nav-per/).
Navigation & perception are building blocks of any robotics, enabling it to make sense of its position from its surroundings - and move to its desired location for tasks.
2. [Human-Robot Interaction](/research/hri/).
A key enabler for robots to interact and communicate with people, augmenting and uplifting their work and lives.
3. [System Capabilities](/research/syscap/).
System capabilities which serves as the 'soul' to connect various parts of the robot.
4. [Reconfigurable Robotics](/research/rec/).
Reconfiguration allows the robots to change their shape to suit the needs of fulfilling tasks or moving around the environment.
5. ["Universal" End Effectors](/research/uni-end/).
End effectors serves as the point of contact for a robot with the physical surroundings. More effective end effectors would mean more effective automation for assembly tasks, allowing humans to take up higher priority tasks.
6. [Assistive Robotics](/research/assistive/).
Assistive robotics augments human capabilities for everyday work and life.
7. [Data-driven Robotics](/research/ddr/).
Data becomes increasingly important for high level simulation and communication. Data-driven robotics even more so becomes a field necessary for optimisation.
8. [Multi-robot Systems](/research/mrs/).
Robots integrated into a society would unlikely be working alone, but would instead be working hand in hand to support the human population. Multiple robots that could collaborate together would also expand their capability in achieving large scale tasks a single unit would have not accomplished.
9. [Trusted Robotics](/research/trusted/).
Developing robotics that could be trusted and relied upon by people, thereby fostering cooperation and acceptance within the community.

## Robotics Domain Specific (RDS) ## {#rds}
Public lead demand refers to the various public good in Singapore that looks at having robotics solutions to improve current work processes. The focus remains on 3 domains for the service and deployment of robotics solutions, in mainly [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Environment](/research/environment/), and [Build Environment](/research/built-environment/).
