## Overview  
Robotics R&D Office (R<sup>2</sup>DO) is the R&D arm of NRP. The office supports robotics R&D projects through 2 funding initiatives (FI); Robotics Enabling Capability Technology (RECT) and Robotics Domain Specific (RDS).

RECT FI focuses on building Robotics technologies applicable to use cases in domain sectors that Singapore is keen to develop; whereas RDS FI co-funds projects with public agencies in [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Built Environment](/research/built-environment/) and [Environmental Services](/research/environment/) to innovate robotic solutions for their problem statements.
  
## NRP R&D Focus Areas

NRP has 9 R&D focus areas:

1. [Navigation & Perception](/research/nav-per/).
Navigation & perception are basic functional components for mobile robots that enable the robot to perform point A to B mobility and perform the assigned task.
2. ["Universal" End Effectors](/research/uni-end/).
Combined with tactile sensors, this track aims to develop end effectors with better dexterity to perform multiple tasks in a few selected domain sectors such as healthcare, logistic and food assembly.
3. [Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)](/research/hri/).
HRI is a critical technology for service robots as it enables the interaction between the robots providing the service with the human receiving the service.
4. [System Capabilities](/research/syscap/).
System capabilities are general components that robots required across multiple domain sectors. Examples are RMF, ROS-I, simulation and physical infra architecture design.
5. [Reconfigurable Robotics](/research/rec/).
Reconfiguration robotics are technologies that allow the robots to adapt their configuration to perform tasks in cluttered and hard-to-reach areas.
6. [Assistive Robotics](/research/assistive/).
Assistive Robotics are developed with the objectives to perform rehabilitation, assistive living for the elderly and augmentation of workers in physically demanding tasks.
7. [Others](/research/others/).

## Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value Projects ## {#rds}
NRP partners with public lead demand agencies to develop POC/POV prototype robotic solutions for the use cases identified. The 3 public domains that NRP focus on are [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Build Environment](/research/built-environment/) and [Environmental Services](/research/environment/).
