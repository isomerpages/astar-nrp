## Overview  
Robotics R&D Office (R<sup>2</sup>DO) is the R&D arm of NRP. The office supports robotics R&D projects through 2 funding initiatives (FI); Robotics Enabling Capability Technology (RECT) and Robotics Domain Specific (RDS).

RECT FI focuses on building Robotics technologies applicable to use cases in domain sectors that Singapore is keen to develop; whereas RDS FI co-funds projects with public agencies in [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Built Environment](/research/built-environment/) and [Environmental Services](/research/environment/) to innovate robotic solutions for their problem statements.

## Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value Projects ## {#rds}
NRP partners with public lead demand agencies to develop POC/POV prototype robotic solutions for the use cases identified. The 3 public domains that NRP focus on are [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Build Environment](/research/built-environment/) and [Environmental Services](/research/environment/).
