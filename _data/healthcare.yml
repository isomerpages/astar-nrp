- title: Standards & System Safety Evaluation Framework For Operations Of Robotic Systems In Hospital
  desc: Standards for the use of robotics in hospitals are largely missing in today's landscape, for safety, reliability and standardisation purposes, even in countries such as Japan. With joint collaboration with the Japan Quality Assurance, a set of safety standards could be crafted and potentially used by many countries.
